### How to manage datasets
1. Decompress the datasets previously downloaded from ./Compressed/ in ./Decompressed/
2. `chmod 777 formatDatasets.bash && ./formatDatasets.bash`
3. Check the results. Vectors inside Vectors/ folder and Images inside Images/ folder
4. Execute the algorithm you prefer, it will create an \*Index.\* inside Indexes/ folder to save the data structure created by the NN-algorithm
